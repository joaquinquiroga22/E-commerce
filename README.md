# Henry


## Vivero E-commerce

This is a student project we made as part of our education at [Soy Henry](https://www.soyhenry.com/), which consisted of creating a full-stack React application from scratch.

### Our stack of technologies:

- Front End:
    + HTML - CSS - Javascript
    + React
    + React-Material-ui
    + Redux

- Back End:
    + Node.js
    + Express
    + Passport
    + Sequelize

- Database: 
    + PostgreSQL

# How to start the project:

If you want to see the page for yourself, you'll need to do the following:

- Clone the repository
- Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder with the following contents: 
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
